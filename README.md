Live Learn Episode 9 -- UI Building
====


## About this project
Part of the [Road to Metaverse, Live Learn Series](https://learn.unity.com/project/road-to-the-metaverse-live), this project was used in Episode 9 to learn how to build a simple Settings Menu user interface. The session is based on the fantastic [Creative Core: UI](https://learn.unity.com/project/creative-core-ui) course.

We added to two sections for Overtime:
- Working with **Dropdown - TextMeshPro** components, incuding handling the change event with Visual Scripting
- Changing an **emmissive material**'s intensity with a slider and Visual Scripting
